# angular-express-tools-seed

Basic structure for a starting app using Angular front-end and Express + Node server-side. After reviewing a few of the popular seed apps I decided to create my own with my preferred folder structure and plenty of the great tools for JS development.

Seed includes basic Angular libraries and several scripts broken down for the server side. Gruntfile with basic jshint and start up configuration. Bower is also included to get our resources for the client-side.
